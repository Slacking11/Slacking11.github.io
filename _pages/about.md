I am a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematical Science](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in stochastic control, transfer learning, and financial mathematics. Currently, my primary focus is on mean field games, a field deeply connected to partial differential equations and stochastic analysis. This area has significant applications in finance and economics, particularly in modeling equilibria in complex systems.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haoyang Cao](https://haoyang-cao.github.io/) from [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) of [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).
