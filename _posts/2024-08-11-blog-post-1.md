There are three reading notes about Mean Field Games, a derivative area in stochastic control. The [first](../files/Notes_on_Mean_Field_Games.pdf) one starts from necessary definitions and leads to the interacting particle systems, where we bring out McKean-Vlasov equation. The [second](../files/Notes_on_Mean_Field_Games__2_.pdf) one focuses on static mean field games and the set up of Nash equilibrium. The [third](../files/Notes_on_Mean_Field_Games__3_.pdf) one introduces the stochatic optimal control.
