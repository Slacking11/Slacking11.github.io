We have specific and concrete build up for different models, using mean field games theory to solve the problem. [1](../files/MFE_model.pdf) is to figure out each agent's best intended arrival time and from this model we can see why its calculation of equilibrium is more efficient than the single N-player game. [2](../files/Production_of_an_exhaustible_resource_and_Mexican_wave.pdf) may lead to some thoughts on the famous finite-fuel problem.
